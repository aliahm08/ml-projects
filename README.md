# ml-projects

This repository now serves as a portfolio index for multiple standalone projects. Each top-level folder is structured so it can be copied or promoted into its own git repository without cross-dependencies.

## Projects

- **iris-handwriting-classifier/** – Logistic regression pipeline adapted from an iris-classifier pattern to recognize handwritten digits (MNIST).
- **titanic-data-pipeline/** – An end-to-end data prep and analysis workflow for the Titanic dataset.

Clone or copy any folder on its own to work with the project independently.
